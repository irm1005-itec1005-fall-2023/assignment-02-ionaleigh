              If this were an actual brand, this is likely the section where I would use a lot of buzzwords like "hope" and "beauty" or something to convince you to buy a $45 t-shirt. Luckily this isn't, so instead I'm just going to show you this picture of a cat that I like and move onto the next section.</p>

          <div class="herowbottom">
            <p>Isn't he cute? Unless you're viewing this site with a screenreader, in which case all you got was the word "cat" in a robotic voice. Just trust me, he's pretty cute.</p>

             <h3>What do you actually sell?</h3>
              <p>We don't know, please stop asking us, it's very stressful.</p>

             <h3>Was the picture of the cat actually cute? I'm using a screenreader and I don't quite trust you.</h3>
              <p>Wow. That's incredibly hurtful. What ever happened to having a little faith in people? I don't even want to answer questions anymore, you've entirely ruined my mood. I'm moving onto the next section.</p>

          <h2>Customer Testimonials</h2>
          <p>After that incredibly hurtful question, I think we could all do with some nice, positive, customer testimonials, such as:</p>
          <ul class="grid-container2">
            <li class="item1">"I just want you guys to leave me alone, I don't even understand what you sell and I doubt you do either. Please stop showing up at my house, you are scaring my neighbours."</li>
            <li class="item2">"dsgaaaaaaaaaa sorry, my cat walked across my keyboard. Wait, who are you?"</li>
            <li class="item3">"I bought a terrible shirt for $45 and feel just ok about it, I guess."</li>

          <h2>Table</h2>
          <p>Alright I'm all out of ideas and am admitting defeat, I no longer know what to add to this website that would even vaguely make sense but I still want full marks so I'm gonna rank all my potential ideas for this section in a table.</p>
